# Charm Robustness Study Configuration
# =====================================
# This config is for the charm-study subcommand, which tests whether
# the y_c ≈ α coincidence is robust under scale-consistent comparisons.
#
# PRE-REGISTERED CHOICES (defined before looking at results):
# - Reference scales: m_c, m_tau, m_Z (fixed, no tuning)
# - Running method: 1-loop QCD for quark masses
# - Null model: log-uniform Yukawas in [1e-6, 1]
# - Look-elsewhere: account for testing multiple α values / scales

analysis:
  name: "charm_robustness_study"
  version: "0.1.0"
  output_dir: "artifacts"
  random_seed: 12345

constants:
  # Use same vev as preregistered analysis for consistency
  vev_GeV: 246.21965

data:
  # PDG masses (same as main analysis)
  pdg_snapshot: "data/pdg_masses_2024_2025.json"
  # Running coupling constants (new file)
  running_constants: "data/running_constants_pdg.json"

# Pre-registered reference scales
# WHY THESE SCALES:
# - m_c: where m_c(m_c) is defined (baseline)
# - m_tau: PDG provides alpha-hat at m_tau; it's near the GeV regime
# - m_Z: canonical electroweak scale; PDG provides alpha-hat at m_Z
reference_scales:
  - "m_c"    # ~1.27 GeV
  - "m_tau"  # ~1.78 GeV
  - "m_Z"    # ~91.2 GeV

monte_carlo:
  n_trials: 100000
  # Note: We use the same null model as the main report:
  # y drawn log-uniform from [1e-6, 1]
